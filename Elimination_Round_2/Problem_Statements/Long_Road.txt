There is a long straight race track consisting of n+1 pit stops (the 1st pit stop is at the start of the race track, and the (n+1)th pit stop is at the end of the race track). The distance between ith and (i+1)th pit stop is equal to li. If someone reaches ith pit stop, the mechanic of the pit stop will add ai fuel into the fuel tank of the racing car.

Imagine you start at pit stop x. You will follow this scheme:

You wait while mechanic is adding the fuel at the current pit stop. Then if you have enough fuel (you spend a unit fuel for travelling a unit length) to reach the next pit stop, you will go to the next pit stop. Then algorithm repeats.
If you do not have enough fuel or you are currently at the last pit stop, you will end the race.
You are given q queries to perform. Each of them is either:

change the amount of fuel in the car at the xth pit stop to y (that is ax=y), or
print, what is the farthest pit stop you can reach if you start race with no fuel at pit stop x.
Input Format

The first line contains an integer n. The next line contains n space separated integers l1,l2,...,ln. The next line contains n space separated integers a1,a2,...,an.

Then follows the line with integer q. Each of the next line contains the description of a query. If the query is of first type, the line contains three integers 1 c d (changing the amount of fuel at pitstop c to d), else the query is of second type and the line contains two integers 2 e ( print the farthest pitstop one can reach if you start the race with 0 fuel at pitstop e ).

Explanation

Look at the sample testcase. The first query starts from 1st pit stop, where you get 2 fuel. Then you spend 1 fuel for the road from 1st pit stop to the 2nd one. On the 2nd pit stop you get 1 fuel. Then you spend 2 fuel for the road from 2nd pit stop to the 3rd one (now you have no fuel). At the 3rd pit stop you get 1 fuel and go to the last pit stop. So, the answer is last pit stop, that is, the 4th.
