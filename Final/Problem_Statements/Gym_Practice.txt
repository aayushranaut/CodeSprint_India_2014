Some time back Fedor decided that competitive programming is not the only thing that is important for him. So now he visits gym every day, because he wants to gain strength and be in good shape. 

Fedor is free to visit the gym during next N days. The days are numbered from 1 to N. His coaches, Olya and Dima, want to make a plan for his trainings so that Fedor would gain the maximal possible amount of strength. 

After googling for some time, they come to know about M exercises. They have to choose a subset of exercises, according to the following constraint, so that total strength gained will be maximal. 

ith exercise is represented by a set of five integers: Li,Ri,Di,Ci,Si. So if ith exercise is opted, it has to be started on Lith day and has to be repeated daily. This repetition has to go on till EndDay day, where EndDay∈[Ri,Di]. When this is done, Si+Ci×(EndDay−Li+1) units of strength is gained. It is not allowed to do more than one exercise in a single day. 

Could you help Fedor's coaches and find the maximal possible amount of strength that he can gain?

Input Format 
The first line of the input contains two space separated integers N and M. 
Then there are M lines, each describing a single exercise with the numbers Li Ri Di Ci Si respectively.

Output Format 
Output the maximal possible amount of strength on the first line of output. It is guaranteed that answer will always fit into 32 bit signed int.

Constraints 
1≤N,M≤100000 
1≤Li≤Ri≤Di≤N 
1≤Si,Ci≤10000

Sample Input

5 2
1 3 5 5 2
4 5 5 10 1
Sample Output

38
Explanation 
He will opt for both exercises.

He will start this exercise at day 1. Though he can stop any day between [3,5], he will stop it at 3rd day. So strength gained is 2+5×(3−1+1)=2+15=17.
He will start second exercise at 4th day and will continue it till 5th day. So he will accumulate strength of worth 1+10×(5−4+1)=1+20=21.
So total strength gained will be 17+21=38 units.
