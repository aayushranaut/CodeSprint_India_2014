Let S(x)={x,xx,xxx,xxxx,...}. It means S(x) contains all of the strings where all of its elements are "x".

And let set U={any string in the world}.

It is obvious that ∀s∈S(a)≤∀t∈(U−S(a)) where s and t denotes a string.

Which means our answer is allways in this format : "aaaa...a".
After then we will find the longest substring at the input and also element of S(a) and append one more a to it's end.
This will be our answer. One can easily do the last part with O(N) complexity.
