Let's say you have a very large water tank and B empty buckets. You also know the capacity (in liters) for each of these buckets.

Given Q integers, is it possible to fill the tank exactly up to each one of these given integers?

You can use each bucket any number of times, but whenever a bucket is used, it must be filled completely with water, i.e., partially-filled buckets cannot be used.

Input Format 
The first line contains two integers B and Q separated by a single space, representing the number of buckets and the number of queries respectively. The next line contains exactly B space separated integers: ith integer represents the capacity of ith bucket in liters. Each of the next Q lines contains an integer C, indicating the amount of water (in liters) that must be filled in the tank.

Output Format 
For each query, output a line containing "yes" if it is possible to fill the tank exactly with the requested amount of water. Otherwise, print "no" (quotes for clarity).

yes
no
Explanation #00

For the first query, we can use the first bucket 2 times and the second one 1 time. 5 + 5 + 3 = 13, hence yes.
