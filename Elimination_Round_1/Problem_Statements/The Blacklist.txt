A new gangster is trying to take control of the city. He makes a list of his N adversaries - gangster 1, gangster 2, ... gangster N-1, gangster N - and plans to get rid of them.

K mercenaries are willing to do this job. The gangster can use any number of these mercenaries. But he has to honor one condition set by them: they have to be assigned in such a way that they eliminate a consecutive group of gangsters in the list, e.g. gangster i, gangster i+1, ..., gangster j-1, gangster j (1 <= i <= j <= N).

While our new gangster wants to kill all of them, he also wants to pay the least amount of money. So he seeks your help.
