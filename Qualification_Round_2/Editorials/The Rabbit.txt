Let's think we want to make k jumps, what is the range we can visit with k jumps? 
If for every jump we choose the small step, then: 
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... + k = k * (k+1) / 2 
If for every jump we chooose the large step, then: 
2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + ... + (k+1) = (k+1)*(k+2)/2 - 1
So we can visit any point in range [k * (k+1) / 2, (k+1)*(k+2)/2 - 1] with k jumps.
So we will test every possible k until we hit x.
