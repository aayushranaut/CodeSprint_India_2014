A rabbit is sitting at x = 0. It can only jump to the right towards the positive x-axis. In the kth jump, the rabbit jumps either k meters or k+1 meters to the right. For example, in the 5th jump the rabbit can jump either 5 meters or 6 meters to the right. How many jumps does the rabbit need to reach point p?

Input Format 
The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. This is followed by T test cases: 
Each test case contains one positive integer p, the point where the rabbit needs to reach.

Output Format 
For each testcase, print in a new line the number of jumps needed for the rabbit to reach point p.

Constraints 
1 ≤ T ≤ 100 
1 ≤ p ≤ 100000000
