Jigar is playing with strings. He likes a string, if all the characters in it are repeated the same number of times. We are given a string of length n, what is the minimum number of changes we have to make in this string so that Jigar likes it? We are only allowed to use lowercase English letters, and we can change any letter to any other letter.

Input Format 
The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. This is followed by T test cases each containing 1 line: 
Each testcase consists of a string composed of lowercase letters.

Output Format 
For each testcase, print in a new line the minimum number of changes required.

Constraints 
1 ≤ T ≤ 1370 
1 ≤ n ≤ 1991 

Sample Input 

2
bbaccaaa
ccaacb
Sample Output 

2
1
Explanation 
One possible solution to first test is bbabbaaa. We have changed 2 'c' to 2 'b'. Now both 'a' and 'b' are repeated 4 times and Jigar would like this string.
