It is to be noted that the point in question will always be inside the rectangle. So, all we have to do is to calculate the possible distance travelled to all the 4 sides of the rectangle from the point and then calculate it's minimum.
Given x,y,x1,y1,x2,y2, let's call the distance needed to travel to left, right, up and down are respectively
a = abs(x - x1)
b = abs(x - x2)
c = abs(y - y2)
d = abs(y - y1)
The minimum value among a,b,c,d is the answer to the question.
