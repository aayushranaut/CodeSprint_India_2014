It should be noted that, some keys are broken. And in that testcase, only those keys need to be repaired that are to be typed.
Ex:- If the broken keys are abcd but if we just need to type ab, then the answer is just 2 and not 4. If we need to type just aa, then the answer is 2 and not 1.
Make a setâˆ’A out of the keys that are to be typed and for every broken key, check if it is present is the A, increment the answer count by 1. Print the answer in the end.
